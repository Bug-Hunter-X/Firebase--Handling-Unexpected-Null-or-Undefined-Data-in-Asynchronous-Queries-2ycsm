# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with Firebase Realtime Database: unexpected null or undefined values when accessing data from asynchronous queries.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows code that's vulnerable to this problem, and `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.  This bug can cause crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.  The solution involves properly handling asynchronous operations and using conditional checks to gracefully handle missing data.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure Firebase for your project (add your config to firebase.js).
4. Run `firebaseBug.js`. Observe the error message.
5. Then run `firebaseBugSolution.js` to see the corrected code in action.
