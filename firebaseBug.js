The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the data retrieved from a database query is unexpectedly null or undefined, especially when directly accessing nested properties of the data.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations and expecting a result before it's actually ready.  For example, if you try to access `snapshot.data().user.name` before `snapshot.data()` has populated, you might get a null pointer exception.
